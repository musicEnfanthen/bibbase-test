 abstract = {In its second module, "Beethovens Werkstatt" deals with five of Beethoven's compositions which exist both in their original versions and as authentic arrangements (Piano Sonata op. 14/1 arranged for string quartet, Septett op. 20 and Trio op. 38, Opferlied op. 121b and Bundeslied op. 122 as piano reductions, Gro{\ss}e Fuge op. 133 as arrangement for piano for four hands op. 134). To demonstrate Beethoven's arrangement practices, the original version of each work is synoptically linked with its arrangement in a digital edition called "VideApp Arr". Through digital tools for comparison the relationships between the two versions can be investigated from different perspectives. It becomes visible how the versions are related to each other both by "invariance" (text elements with the same structure), by "variance" (text elements with a similar structure) and, in special cases, also by "difference" (text elements without corresponding parameters). Each view within the "VideApp Arr" is generated from the underlying MEI data.},

@inproceedings{Seipelt_2020,
 abstract = {The poster shows the results obtained in the project "Digital Music Analysis with the Techniques of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) using Anton Bruckner's compositional studies as an example" (2017 to 2019). On the one hand, the project had the goal of presenting a digital edition of Anton Bruckner's study book, which he produced during his lessons with Otto Kitzler from 1861 to 1863. An edition of the music in the textbook encoded with MEI and displayed using Verovio and the facsimile can be displayed simultaneously. On the other hand, an automated harmonic analysis of this music was to be designed. For this purpose, keys are recognized using the Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm that is based on a resource of pitch classes which are compared with reference values and thus their similarity is calculated. Based on this, chord recognitions are carried out, which are then linked to the keys in the last step and converted to a roman numeral analysis.},

 abstract = {Algorithmic automation of the complex music notation rules in MEI--XML through the example of the accidentals: The article demonstrates how music notation rules can be formalized into a computer algorithm. In particular, it handles the rule, whether the accidentals should be rendered or not when they repeat on the notes of the same pitch in the same measure. The decision process is described step-by-step while referring to the music notation rules. The algorithm was implemented in the XSLT-language for the needs of the Digital Interactive Mozart Edition and can be applied to MEI data. The tool can be downloaded from <https://github.com/ismdme/DIME-tools>.},
