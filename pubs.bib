 abstract = {The poster shows the results obtained in the project "Digital Music Analysis with the Techniques of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) using Anton Bruckner's compositional studies as an example" (2017 to 2019). On the one hand, the project had the goal of presenting a digital edition of Anton Bruckner's study book, which he produced during his lessons with Otto Kitzler from 1861 to 1863. An edition of the music in the textbook encoded with MEI and displayed using Verovio and the facsimile can be displayed simultaneously. On the other hand, an automated harmonic analysis of this music was to be designed. For this purpose, keys are recognized using the Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm that is based on a resource of pitch classes which are compared with reference values and thus their similarity is calculated. Based on this, chord recognitions are carried out, which are then linked to the keys in the last step and converted to a roman numeral analysis.},
