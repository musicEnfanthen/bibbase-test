 abstract = {Since the analysis of transmission aims for the reconstruction of relations between sources, it focuses on the differences of rather similar items. Therefore, it is necessary to find substitution models which are optimized for distinguishing fine levels of differences and to deal with the structural ambiguities and visual variance of mensural notation. This book reports on the task of developing concepts for a computational analysis of the transmission of mensural music based on concepts of phylogenetic analysis. Part one lays the theoretical foundations, wrapping the key assumptions of stemmatics for 15th and 16th century mensural music and the computational methods of phylogenetic analysis. Part two covers in a case study the methodological and domain-specific requirements of mensural music, follows main questions of encoding and sequence-building up to an approach utilizing surrogate data analysis to determine the most suitable substitution model for a comparison of sources.},

 abstract = {Some librarians are born to digital humanities; some aspire to digital humanities; and some have digital humanities thrust upon them. Digital Humanities For Librarians is a one-stop resource for librarians and LIS students working in this growing new area of academic librarianship. The book begins by introducing digital humanities, addressing key questions such as, "What is it?", "Who does it?", "How do they do it?", "Why do they do it?", and "How can I do it?". This broad overview is followed by a series of practical chapters answering those questions with step-by-step approaches to both the digital and the human elements of digital humanities librarianship.},

@inproceedings{Cox_2020,
 abstract = {In its second module, "Beethovens Werkstatt" deals with five of Beethoven's compositions which exist both in their original versions and as authentic arrangements (Piano Sonata op. 14/1 arranged for string quartet, Septett op. 20 and Trio op. 38, Opferlied op. 121b and Bundeslied op. 122 as piano reductions, Gro{\ss}e Fuge op. 133 as arrangement for piano for four hands op. 134). To demonstrate Beethoven's arrangement practices, the original version of each work is synoptically linked with its arrangement in a digital edition called "VideApp Arr". Through digital tools for comparison the relationships between the two versions can be investigated from different perspectives. It becomes visible how the versions are related to each other both by "invariance" (text elements with the same structure), by "variance" (text elements with a similar structure) and, in special cases, also by "difference" (text elements without corresponding parameters). Each view within the "VideApp Arr" is generated from the underlying MEI data.},

 abstract = {The poster shows the results obtained in the project "Digital Music Analysis with the Techniques of the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) using Anton Bruckner's compositional studies as an example" (2017 to 2019). On the one hand, the project had the goal of presenting a digital edition of Anton Bruckner's study book, which he produced during his lessons with Otto Kitzler from 1861 to 1863. An edition of the music in the textbook encoded with MEI and displayed using Verovio and the facsimile can be displayed simultaneously. On the other hand, an automated harmonic analysis of this music was to be designed. For this purpose, keys are recognized using the Krumhansl-Schmuckler algorithm that is based on a resource of pitch classes which are compared with reference values and thus their similarity is calculated. Based on this, chord recognitions are carried out, which are then linked to the keys in the last step and converted to a roman numeral analysis.},

In particular, it handles the rule, whether the accidentals should be rendered or not when they repeat on the notes of the same pitch in the same measure. The decision process is described step-by-step while referring to the music notation rules. The algorithm was implemented in the XSLT-language for the needs of the Digital Interactive Mozart Edition and can be applied to MEI data.
