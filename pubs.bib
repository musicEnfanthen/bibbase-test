 abstract = {Digital music writing encodings pose challenges: They force us to question, rethink and renegotiate the concept of musical writing and notation which has shaped the historiography of music in the Latin-Western cultural sphere since its beginnings. How can digital forms of musical writing be integrated into and theoretically addressed by a concept of writing? Are writing and notation the same? What are the similarities, what the differences between historical and contemporary forms of music writing? Following a terminological clarification of the relevant concepts, this paper will approach these questions from a sign-theoretical perspective by contrasting the (non-music-specific) notation models of Nelson Goodman and Roy Harris and examining their suitability as possible descriptive models in connection with musical notation. Finally, with the concept of musical notation developed from this model, some nowadays commonly used music encoding formats (MEI, Lilypond, and MusicOWL) will briefly be considered. Ultimately, the questions raised are intended to illuminate a sub-area of that medial area of tension which the notation of music still opens up in various ways, time and again.},

@inproceedings{Torrente-LLorens_2022,
 abstract = {Musicology is a small discipline within the wide spectrum of human knowledge, yet it is already divided into various branches, each with its own societies, conferences, journals, jargons, degrees, prejudices, $\ldots$, and jobs. Although they share their object of investigation -- ``the art of music as a physical, psychological, aesthetic, and cultural phenomenon'' --, these branches very often ignore one another. Research in musicology is mostly a solitary task, as investigations, papers, and publications are commonly signed by single authors, in contrast with STEM disciplines where teamwork is the rule. This is in part the result of tradition -- the ``Musicological Toolbox'' -- but also the aftermath of the job market and financing programs.

Large funding schemes such as the European Research Council (ERC) grants are becoming a major disruptive factor in many disciplines in the humanities, including musicology. Scholars in all fields now have the opportunity to build research teams, and most of their members receive their salaries to exclusively work on the project. In other words, we are starting to build what could be called a Musicology Lab, learning along the way how teamwork is reshaping and transforming the Musicological Toolbox, the look and feel of our discipline, the way we work as well as the way we publish and disseminate our results.

This paper presents some of the key features of the ERC Didone project, one of its principal tasks being to create a digitally encoded corpus of some 3,000 arias in MusicXML format from about 180 musical settings of a small number of opera librettos by Pietro Metastasio. It focuses on some of the project's research tasks, emphasizing how the skills of a team of eighteen scholars with very different expertise -- historical musicology, music theory and analysis, cultural history, librettology, archival research, music performance, music engraving, MIR, computer science, and statistical modeling -- combine to explore the potential answer(s) to the main research question of the project: How are emotions expressed through music?},

One of the main areas of research within the DCML is corpus studies with large amounts of encoded notation. They maintain a number of encodings entered in MuseScore, but use the MEI format in their analysis and publishing toolchain. The current workflow, which imports MusicXML and then converts it to MEI or MuseScore, has impeded the growth of high-quality corpora, primarily due to ambiguities within the MusicXML format itself. A direct conversion method between MEI and MuseScore was identified as the solution to these issues. MEI support in MuseScore would also benefit the wider MEI community.},

It thus has provided a parallel to historical musicology's long-standing (since the 19th century) conception of musical scores as musical works. The past quarter-century, in particular, has seen an expansion of musicological research to include performance studies based on the use of audio-visual recordings as primary source documents. Not least in the context of current considerations to expand the coding options of the format to include audiovisual elements, the limits of this current structuring become apparent. The question therefore arises whether the existing MEI structures are sufficient to respond to this performance oriented turn, or if they should be questioned and adapted as necessary in order to better align the data format with current developments and considerations in musicological research and neighbouring disciplines.},
